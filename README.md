# LibraryManagementSystem
This SQL script establishes a comprehensive library management system for a fictional library. It includes the creation of a new database, definition of tables for publishers, books, library branches, borrowers, book loans, book copies, and authors, along with sample data insertion for each table. Additionally, it features stored procedures for common library queries, such as tracking book copies across branches, identifying borrowers with no loans, and reporting on loans per branch and books checked out by borrowers. This system provides a robust framework for managing library operations and data.
